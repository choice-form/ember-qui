      <b style="font-size: 14px; line-height:50px;">Statement of Rights and Responsibilities</b><br> This Statement of
      Rights and Responsibilities ("Statement," "Terms," or "SRR") derives from the<a> Choiceform Principles</a>, and is
      our terms of service that governs our relationship with users and others who interact with Choiceform, as well as Choiceform brands, products
      and services, which we call the <a>“Choiceform Services” or “Services”</a>. By using
      or accessing the Choiceform Services, you agree to this Statement, as updated from time to time in accordance with
      Section 13 below. Additionally, you will find resources at the end of this document that help you understand how
      Choiceform works.
    </div>

    <ol style="margin: 18px auto;">
      <li style="margin-bottom: 16px;"><b>Privacy</b><br><br> Your privacy is very important to us. We designed our
        <a>Data Policy</a> to make important disclosures about how you can use Choiceform to share
        with others and how we collect and can use your content and information. We encourage you to read the
        <a>Data Policy</a>, and to use it to help you make informed decisions. <br> &nbsp;</li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 16px;"><b>Sharing Your Content and Information</b><br><br> You own all of the content
        and information you post on Choiceform, and you can control how it is shared through your <a>privacy</a> and
        <a>application settings</a>.
        In addition:
        <ol>
          <li> For content that is covered by intellectual property rights, like photos and videos (IP content), you
            specifically give us the following permission, subject to your <a>privacy</a> and <a>application
              settings</a>: you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide
            license to use any IP content that you post on or in connection with Choiceform (IP License). This IP
            License ends when you delete your IP content or your account unless your content has been shared with
            others, and they have not deleted it.
          </li>
          <li> When you delete IP content, it is deleted in a manner similar to emptying the recycle bin on a
            computer. However, you understand that removed content may persist in backup copies for a reasonable
            period of time (but will not be available to others).
          </li>
          <li> When you use an application, the application may ask for your permission to access your content and
            information as well as content and information that others have shared with you.&nbsp; We require
            applications to respect your privacy, and your agreement with that application will control how the
            application can use, store, and transfer that content and information.&nbsp; (To learn more about
            Platform, including how you can control what information other people may share with applications, read
            our <a>Data Policy</a> and <a>Platform Page</a>.)
          </li>
          <li> When you publish content or information using the Public setting, it means that you are allowing
            everyone, including people off of Choiceform, to access and use that information, and to associate it with
            you (i.e., your name and profile picture).
          </li>
          <li> We always appreciate your feedback or other suggestions about Choiceform, but you understand that we may
            use your feedback or suggestions without any obligation to compensate you for them (just as you have no
            obligation to offer them).<br> &nbsp;</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 16px;"><b>Registration and Account Security</b><br><br> Choiceform users provide their
        real names and information, and we need your help to keep it that way. Here are some commitments you make to
        us relating to registering and maintaining the security of your account:
        <ol>
          <li> You will not provide any false personal information on Choiceform, or create an account for anyone other
            than yourself without permission.
          </li>
          <li> You will not create more than one personal account.</li>
          <li> If we disable your account, you will not create another one without our permission.</li>
          <li> You will not use your personal timeline primarily for your own commercial gain, and will use a Choiceform
            Page for such purposes.
          </li>
          <li> You will not use Choiceform if you are under 13.</li>
          <li> You will not use Choiceform if you are a convicted sex offender.</li>
          <li> You will keep your contact information accurate and up-to-date.</li>
          <li> You will not share your password (or in the case of developers, your secret key), let anyone else
            access your account, or do anything else that might jeopardize the security of your account.
          </li>
          <li> You will not transfer your account (including any Page or application you administer) to anyone without
            first getting our written permission.
          </li>
          <li> If you select a username or similar identifier for your account or Page, we reserve the right to remove
            or reclaim it if we believe it is appropriate (such as when a trademark owner complains about a username
            that does not closely relate to a user's actual name).<br> &nbsp;</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 16px;"><b>Protecting Other People's Rights</b><br><br> We respect other people's
        rights, and expect you to do the same.
        <ol>
          <li> You will not post content or take any action on Choiceform that infringes or violates someone else's
            rights or otherwise violates the law.
          </li>
          <li> We can remove any content or information you post on Choiceform if we believe that it violates this
            Statement or our policies.
          </li>
          <li> We provide you with tools to help you protect your intellectual property rights. To learn more, visit
            our <a>How to Report Claims of Intellectual Property Infringement</a> page.
          </li>
          <li> If we remove your content for infringing someone else's copyright, and you believe we removed it by
            mistake, we will provide you with an opportunity to appeal.
          </li>
          <li> If you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property rights, we will disable your account
            when appropriate.
          </li>
          <li> You will not use our copyrights or Trademarks or any confusingly similar marks, except as expressly
            permitted by our Brand Usage Guidelines or with our prior written permission.
          </li>
          <li> If you collect information from users, you will: obtain their consent, make it clear you (and not
            Choiceform) are the one collecting their information, and post a privacy policy explaining what information
            you collect and how you will use it.

        <ol>
          <li> We currently provide our mobile services for free, but please be aware that your carrier's normal rates
            and fees, such as text messaging and data charges, will still apply.

          <li> In the event you change or deactivate your mobile telephone number, you will update your account
            information on Choiceform within 48 hours to ensure that your messages are not sent to the person who
